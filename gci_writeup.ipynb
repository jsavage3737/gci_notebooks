    "Many communities around the world have little to no access to modern health care. Within our own country, there are two major groups with limited access: those without money for health-care, and those who are far from their nearest healthcare provider. In both circumstances listed, artificial intelligence provides a solution. In poverty-stricken areas, human doctors are costly while an open-source software-based diagnosis system would be cheap. In rural areas without access to experienced or well-trained doctors, medical technicians would be able to perform at a similar level."

    "We began this project last semester with no knowledge of neural networks. ~75% of our work last semester was in researching our topic while ~25% was becoming familiar with the high-level API [Keras](https://keras.io/). This semester, we've been able to focus completely on model development and assessment and have created 2 unsuccessful models and 1 moderately successful model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial model was of the Xception architecture **(XCEPTION CITATION)** and was trained on the untouched dataset divided into subclasses. Xception is an adjusted version of Google's publicly released Inception model **(INCEPTION CITATION)**. Both architectures contain specialized layers where multiple convolutional operations are performed on the same tensor. Inception modules concatonate the outputs of these operations while Xception maps the all outputs directly to a tensor of the same x and y dimensions. \n",

    "\n",
    "We chose Xception because it's been reliably proven to be more accurate than the other architecture while also being relatively quick to train ([compared to the other architectures available natively within keras](https://keras.io/applications/)). This model proved to be a failure due to reasons discussed in the **Dataset** section. This model was extremely biased towards classifying images as being heathy. \n",
